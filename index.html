            There are two main points associated with if homelessness is a
            choice or not
          </section>
          <section>
            The first point is the triggers that brings people onto the streets
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              For instance, the leading trigger which results in individuals
              ending up on the streets is the lack of affordable long term
              housing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This trigger is clearly not in the hands of the individuals. The
              government is mostly responsible for providing access to
              individuals who cannot afford housing
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            The second reason homeless is not a choice is associated with the
            lengths for which individuals are homeless
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              The main cause for this again is a lack of access to affordable
              housing.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as lack of government funding and help for individuals who
              are most at risk of going homeless such as individuals being
              discharged from prison or hospital
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              There are other factors involved that indicates why individuals
              have to remain homeless such as safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often couples are discriminated against at homeless shelters, thus
              couples often choose to remain together on the streets in order to
              keep each other safe

            />
            <p>
              This graph shows the increase in people without homes in England
              between 2010 and 2016
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              One major contributing factor is homeless people not being able to
              find housing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without effective housing solutions that scale well, the homeless
              population is left to the streets, and will only grow as time goes
              on with no other options.

            How can this issue be addressed?

              There are many proposed solutions, ranging from simply building
              more affordable housing to creating a new affordable housing tax
              credit.
